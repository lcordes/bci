def test_math():
    assert 10 // 2 == 5


## Possible tests:

# RecordingHandler, assert that all lists in self.onsets have len 45

# filter, check that 10s, 20s, whole recording filters are same/similar for given segment

# get_data, make sure marker 8,9 are handled correctly

# check train_model works on single user and list

# check test_model works on single user and list

# forward selection, check that best_acc in data is indeed argmax(accs)
